;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Ellama is a tool for interacting with large language models from Emacs.
;; It allows you to ask questions and receive responses from the
;; LLMs.  Ellama can perform various tasks such as translation, code
;; review, summarization, enhancing grammar/spelling or wording and
;; more through the Emacs interface.  Ellama natively supports streaming
;; output, making it effortless to use with your preferred text editor.
